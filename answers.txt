Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Keep up the grind!!!

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
'git fetch' brings the changes from the remote (central) directory to the local directory. For example, the edit I made on answers.txt on GitHub did not automatically update on my local directory, so I ran git fetch to update this change.
Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
