Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
git add, git commit, and git push are the three commands to transfer something from your local computer to GitHub.

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
'git clone' creates a copy of a repository on GitHub on your local machine.

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
'git status' tells you whether your local repository is up to date with the central repository's master branch and if it's not what you need to do to make it up to date.

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
It tells you that your local repository and the central repository on GitHub are in sync.

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
You need to run git pull to pull any changed from the central repository first.

Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
Yes your code is saved because git commit saved a snapshot to be pushed to the central repository which you can simply pull from to retrieve your code after pushing.

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
No, since your local repository is deleted you cannot push the committed changes, so unfortunately your code is gone.
